## Hi there!!!

I'm a software engineer currently working at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics on spacecraft instrument automation software.

When I was in high school and early college, I was passionate about programming games.
This interest has been very helpful for me because it taught me how to effectively write code for long-term projects.

I have five repositories (besides this one) available on my page.

Here's a description of each of them:

Frontscope:
  - This is an open source math research tool I worked on for a fall internship in undergrad.
  - It's official name is Numberscope.
  - I made a grid visualizer based on Ulam's spiral with 9 customizable parameters.
  - You can select any number sequences from the Online Encyclopedia of Number Sequences to test it out.
  - Here's a link to it: https://numberscope.colorado.edu/doc/src/visualizers/Grid/

Caldera:
  - This is an open source cybersecurity tool I worked on for a summer internship in high school.
  - I created a data generation tool so that Caldera could be tested on large amounts of data.

Basic Platformer Engine:
  - This is a platformer engine I made from scratch in Java.

Arrangement:
  - This is a puzzle game about the complex properties that arise from arranging shapes.

50 Compositions in Yellow:
  - This is a puzzle platformer game based on the idea of teleporting relative to a point.
  - I made it using the Basic Platformer Engine I made.
